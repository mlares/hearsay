The abundance of intelligent civilisations in the Galaxy is a
  longstanding question related to the expected probability
  of success for SETI programs.  Traditional approaches to quantify
  this problem use either frequentist inferences or numerical
  simulations. The key challenges in both cases are the proper
  treatment of the time variable and the large uncertainties on the
  intervening factors. Here we present a three-parametric
  statistical model of the network of causally connected locations in
  a simplified Galaxy, with the restriction of a maximum distance
  range for any signal. We implement Monte Carlo simulations of this
  model to explore the parameter space and analyse the probabilities
  of causal contacts for random locations in the Galaxy.
  
We find
  that, given the enormous distances involved, causal contacts
  between civilisations would be very rare. The odds to make a
  contact in a few years of monitoring are low for most models,
  except for those of a galaxy densely populated with ancient
  civilisations. The probability of causal contacts increases with
  the lifetime of civilisations more significantly than with the
  number of active civilisations. We show that the maximum
  probability of making a contact occurs when a civilization
  discovers the required communication technology.


Methods and working hypothesis
==============================

Simulations are suitable tools to analyze systems that evolve with
time and involve randomness.

An advantage of simulations compared to theoretical approaches, is
that the former usually require less assumptions and simplifications,
and can be applied to systems where a theoretical model can not be
found.

In particular, many complex stochastic processes that can be described
by the evolution of the state of a system, can be efficiently modeled
with the discrete--event (hereafter, DE) simulation approach.

A system described with the DE paradigm is characterized by a set of
actors and events, where actors interact causally through a series of
events on a timeline and process these events in chronological order
